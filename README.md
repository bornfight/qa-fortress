# qa-fortress

Idea of Quality Assurance Fortress is to set automated type structure of testing tools covered with up to date documentation.

Here are some links:

* Initial papers - [doc file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOxVAY6QLKMddnGBApYQdoiHpAf2g4mUwWk3Ibrwkpg/edit?usp=sharing)

* Types of testing approaches - [sheet file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBx5GVdU08WgqkFdxSwlHzpEs4Ok-rYyHtbq_byiQSk/edit?usp=sharing)

### TODO

- [ ] Arrange project inside robust test management tool
- [ ] Update mind map png file on [MindMup](https://www.mindmup.com/)
- [ ] Add security, blockchain and testing approache (connect them with corresponding tools) components to mind map
