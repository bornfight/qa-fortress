# qa-fortress

Idea of Quality Assurance Fortress is to set (potentialy) automated type structure of testing tools covered with up to date documentation.

***Here are some links:***

* Initial papers - [doc file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOxVAY6QLKMddnGBApYQdoiHpAf2g4mUwWk3Ibrwkpg/edit?usp=sharing)

* Types of testing approaches - [sheet file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBx5GVdU08WgqkFdxSwlHzpEs4Ok-rYyHtbq_byiQSk/edit?usp=sharing)

* Mindpmup original file (with links available) - [mindmup file](https://atlas.mindmup.com/degordianqa/qa_fortress/index.html)

***Please feel free to contribute!*** :blush: 
:point_right: [Contribute guidelines](https://github.com/degordian/qa-fortress/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

***Mental map nodes explained:***
* 'Helpy stuff' - additional (mostly free) tools and accessories that can help you out in your testing environment (difference between them and "TOOLS" node is that "Heply stuff" has more subjective usage than objective).

* 'Local documentation' - extract from official documentation on choosen tool; simple and additional usage explanation for easier ongoing use of choosen tool.

* 'Support HQ' - "branches" that go beyonde QA fields, but from where trunk stands. :palm_tree:
